/**
 * The <code>Color</code> class is used to encapsulate colors in the default
 * sRGB color space or colors in arbitrary color spaces identified by a
 * {@link ColorSpace}.  Every color has an implicit alpha value of 1.0 or
 * an explicit one provided in the constructor.  The alpha value
 * defines the transparency of a color and can be represented by
 * a float value in the range 0.0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.0 or 0&nbsp;-&nbsp;255.
 * An alpha value of 1.0 or 255 means that the color is completely
 * opaque and an alpha value of 0 or 0.0 means that the color is
 * completely transparent.
 * When constructing a <code>Color</code> with an explicit alpha or
 * getting the color/alpha components of a <code>Color</code>, the color
 * components are never premultiplied by the alpha component.
 * <p>
 * The default color space for the Java 2D(tm) API is sRGB, a proposed
 * standard RGB color space.  For further information on sRGB,
 * see <A href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html">
